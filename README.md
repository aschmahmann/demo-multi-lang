## Demo 1:  DHT Peer & Content with Go and JS Nodes

**Directory**:  `content-dht-provide-find`

**What it demonstrates:**  A new DHT is created by the Go program `dht-interop`.  In a separate terminal or machine, a Node.js program connects to this DHT.  One connected, each verifies that it can find the other's content via the DHT.

**First terminal:**
```
cd content-dht-provide-find
make
./dht-interop
```

**Second terminal:**  run the command printed out by dht-interop, replacing 127.0.0.1 with the IP of the server where dht-interop is listening.  Example:

First time only:
```
cd js-dht-test
npm install
```

Running the Node.js program:
```
node js-dht-test/index.js /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/9876/ipfs/QmehVYruznbyDZuHBV4vEHESpDevMoAovET6aJ9oRuEzWa
```

Note that the node ID of `dht-interop` is always `Qm...6aJ9oRuEzWa` because it is being read in from `util/private_key.bin` (a private key marshalled to X.509 generated by `util/private-key-gen`).  This is to keep the peer id of the bootstrap server stable across invocations.


## Demo 2:  PubSub

**Directory**:  `pubsub`

**What it demonstrates**:  Two Go nodes are created and run a chat server using a shared PubSub topic.  **TODO**:  Should be a Go node and a JS node, once I get the two Go nodes version working.

TODO:  show how to run
